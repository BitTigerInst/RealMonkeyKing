Language & Framework

<h2>Development Guildlines</h2>
<p>
Modularity. Following the principle "loose coupling and high cohesion", each module should be standalone.</br>

Minimalism. Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading.</br>

Easy extensibility. New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.</br>
